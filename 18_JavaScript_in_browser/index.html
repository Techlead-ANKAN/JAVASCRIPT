    <h1>JavaScript in Browser</h1>

    <p id="p1">It is commonly used for creating web pages. It allows us to add dynamic behaviour and add special effects
        to the webpages, bringing the web pages alive.</p>


    <p id="p2"><b>JavaScript engines</b> are typically developed by web browser vendors, and every major browser has
        one. In a browser, the JavaScript engine runs in concert with the "rendering engine" via the " Document Object
        Model (DOM)" and Web IDL bindings. However, the use of JavaScript engines is not limited to browsers; for
        example, the "V8 engine" is a core component of the Node.js runtime system.</p>

    <p id="p3"><b>Rendering Engine</b> (Link - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_engine) <br>
        A browser engine is a core software component of every major web browser. The primary job of a browser engine is
        to transform HTML documents and other resources of a web page into an interactive visual representation on a
        user's device.</p>


    <p id="p4"><b>Documnet Object Model (DOM)</b>(Link - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) <br>
        The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an HTML or
        XML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document. The DOM
        represents a document with a logical tree. </p>

    <p id="p5"><b>Web IDL</b> is an <b>Interface Description Language (IDL)</b> format for describing APIs (application
        programming interfaces) that are intended to be implemented in web browsers. Its adoption was motivated by the
        desire to improve the interoperability of web programming interfaces by specifying how languages such as
        ECMAScript should bind these interfaces.</p>

    <p id="p6"><b>Script Tag</b><br>The script tag is used to embed client side script (JavaScript). It either contains
        scripting elements or it points to an external script file through the src attribute.

        Note - Overall, there are many benefits to having a separate JavaScript file. It can improve the organization,
        reusability, performance, readability, and maintainability of your website.</p>

    <p id="p7"><b>Console Object</b><br>The console object provides acces to the browsers debugging console.
        The console object is a property of the window object.</p>

    <p id="p8">The console object can be accessed by :
        <br>
        1)<b>window.console</b>
        <br>
        <i>window.console.log("Using window.console");</i>

        <br>
        2) <b>console</b>
        <br>
        <i>console.log("Using console");</i>
    </p>

    <p id="p10"><b>JavaScript Interaction prompt(), alert(), confirm()</b><br>
        Javascript allows us the privilege to which we can interact with the user and respond accordingly. It includes
        several user-interface functions which help in the interaction. Let’s take a look at them one by one.
        <br><br>
        1) JavaScript Window alert() Method : It simply creates an alert box that may or may not have specified content
        inside it, but it always comes with the ‘OK’ button. It simply shows a message and pauses the execution of the
        script until you press the ‘OK’ button. The mini-window that pops up is called the ‘modal window’.
    </p>
    <button onclick="alert_func()">Show Alert</button>
    <br>

    <p id="p11">2) JavaScript Window prompt() Method: Prompt is another user-interface function that normally contains
        two arguments.
        <br>prompt('text', default value);
        <br>The text is basically what you want to show the user and the default value argument is optional though it
        acts like a placeholder inside a text field. It is the most used interface as with it you can ask the user to
        input something and then use that input to build something.
    </p>
    <button onclick="prompt_func()">Show Prompt</button>

    <p id="p12">3) JavaScript Window confirm() Method: The confirm function basically outputs a modal window with a
        question and two buttons ‘OK’ and ‘CANCEL’.</p>
    <button onclick="confirm_func()">Show Confirm</button>
