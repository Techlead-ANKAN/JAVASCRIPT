A. Functions

1. Build a greeting generator function (regular, arrow, expression versions).
2. Create a function factory that returns functions (e.g., createMultiplier(2) returns a function that doubles numbers).
3. Implement a higher-order function that takes another function as input and applies it to an array.
4. Write a debounce function from scratch (delays execution until user stops typing).
5. Write a throttle function (limit clicks to once every 2 seconds).
6. Build a function composition utility (compose(f,g)(x) â†’ f(g(x))).
7. Implement a custom event logger using higher-order functions.
