A. Functions

1. Build a greeting generator function (regular, arrow, expression versions).
2. Create a function factory that returns functions (e.g., createMultiplier(2) returns a function that doubles numbers).
3. Implement a higher-order function that takes another function as input and applies it to an array.
4. Write a debounce function from scratch (delays execution until user stops typing).
5. Write a throttle function (limit clicks to once every 2 seconds).
6. Build a function composition utility (compose(f,g)(x) â†’ f(g(x))).
7. Implement a custom event logger using higher-order functions.

B. DOM Manipulation

1. Create a dark mode toggle button.
2. Build a real-time character counter for a text area.
3. Implement a to-do list app (add, delete, mark as done).
4. Make a dropdown menu that opens/closes on click.
5. Create a form validator (email, password length, required fields).
6. Build a modal popup with open/close buttons.
7. Implement event delegation for a list (clicking on items shows their text).
8. Create a dynamic table from a JS array of objects.
9. Build an accordion/FAQ section (expand/collapse items).
10. Add infinite scrolling UI with dummy content.
